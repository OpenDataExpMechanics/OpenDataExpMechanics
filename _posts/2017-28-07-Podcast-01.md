With our first epsiode we intent to get feedback form potential users from experimental mechnanics and computational engineering of our project idea. 
Therefore, we interviewed three of our colleauges: Tanja Pelzmann, Antonio Castro Moreno, and  [Yahya Abderrafai](https://twitter.com/lussylver) to get their opinion
of our idea and evaluate if there is need for such a platform in both communities. 

### Content

We asked them following questions

* Please introduce yourself and your research
* Do you use experimental data in your research?
* Did you ever need to acquire or get experimental results?
* Did you ever need to contact someone to get their raw experimental results ? How did it go ?
* What features should the platform have ?

### Conclusion
