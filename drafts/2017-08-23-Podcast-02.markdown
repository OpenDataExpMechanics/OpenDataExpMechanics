During the [PKP conference](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp2017/), we heard a really interesting talk about the [Scielo](http://www.scielo.br/) _(**Sci**entific **E**lectronic **L**ibrary **O**nline)_. The platform allows authors to publish their papers from Brazil, which is the country from which the country originated, but it also became a model for more than 14 countries which are now using their own Scielo publishing systems to manage publishing. An important point here is that all papers on the Scielo platform are **Open access**, not all of them are in english, but Scielo Brazil is currently encouraging all Scielo publishing plaptform to push for more english publications.
Scielo recently anounced that they will soon also have a preprint server and are thinking of starting an **open data platform** to support their publications. The platform is truely pushing for open standards and sharing.

That is how we met **Alex Mendonca**, who is a member of coordination team of the Scielo organization. We were mostly interested in the open data platform they are working and had questions about how the platform should be designed, which features it should propose and which main issues it will have to deal with. We recorded a 16 minutes interview with Alex during the PKP, you an listen to this episode here.
