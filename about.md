### Brief description of our goals

Accessible reliable and fully described experimental data is critically lacking in the materials/mechanics community to validate accurate predictive models.
Our project proposes a platform for researchers to present their experimental results as standardized datasets. Experimental researchers can then obtain a DOI for their datasets, making them citable by others.
