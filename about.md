### Brief description of our goals

Accessible reliable and fully described experimental data is critically lacking in the materials/mechanics community to validate accurate predictive models. Recently, we investigated the long term availability of raw experimental data in experimental fracture mechanics. Currently, we research on review processes for experimental data, like for publications, to not only provide raw experimental data instead we like to make them valuable, i.e. having a proper description or the description of the experimental setup, for other researchers.
