In our first episode Tanja mentioned the [Open Data Portal Austria](https://www.opendataportal.at/) which is an initiative backed by the Austrian government which provides a website for people to look for open data sets and catalog data sets. The platform features data from companies mostly.
In this episode we interviewed [Clara Landler](https://twitter.com/clara_l), who is a program manager for this initiative. Since the platform exists for three years our goal was to extract information about open data in general and specifically for ODEM. 

We can conclude with two major points. First, the concept of open data is at least in Austria not widely spread. Especially it is not easy to convince companies to share their data. Second, building a platform is easy, building a community around it is not so easy but essential
for receiving data sets and encourage people to update them.
